# Toast Responsiveness Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement responsive toasts across the AA Homes application.

## Overview

The goal was to make all toast notifications responsive so they display appropriately on all device sizes. This involved:
1. Creating a responsive toast hook
2. Updating components to use the responsive hook
3. Maintaining the existing duplicate prevention system in hooks
4. Adding responsive CSS styles

## Key Components Updated

### 1. Custom Hook: `useResponsiveToast`
- **File**: `src/hooks/useResponsiveToast.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Detects mobile devices based on screen width and user agent
  - Adjusts toast positioning (top-center for mobile, top-right for desktop)
  - Provides responsive functions for all toast types
  - Includes improved mobile detection logic

### 2. CSS Styles
- **File**: `src/styles/globals.css`
- **Features**:
  - Responsive width adjustments for different screen sizes
  - Font size scaling for better readability
  - Proper spacing and stacking on mobile devices
  - Media queries for screens under 768px and 480px

### 3. Toast Container Configuration
- **File**: `src/pages/_app.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Proper positioning with top and right offsets
  - Responsive width settings
  - Limit of 3 simultaneous toasts
  - Accessible attributes (role, aria-live)

## Components Updated to Use Responsive Toast Hook

### Profile Components
1. **Profile Update** (`src/pages/profile/update/index.tsx`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated all toast calls to use responsive functions

2. **Profile Change Password** (`src/pages/profile/change/index.tsx`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated all toast calls to use responsive functions

### Schedule Components
1. **Schedule Dashboard** (`src/pages/schedule/index.tsx`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated error handling to use responsive functions

2. **Schedule Visit** (`src/pages/schedule/visit/index.tsx`)
   - Removed unused direct `toast` import
   - Ensured all toast calls use responsive functions

3. **Schedule Modal** (`src/pages/schedule/ScheduleModal.tsx`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated all toast calls to use responsive functions

### Auth Components
1. **Login** (`src/pages/auth/login/index.js`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated all toast calls to use responsive functions

2. **Signup** (`src/pages/auth/signup/index.js`)
   - Replaced direct `toast` imports with `useResponsiveToast`
   - Updated all toast calls to use responsive functions

## Hooks Maintaining Duplicate Prevention

The following hooks continue to use direct `toast` imports with ID-based duplicate prevention:

1. **Property Hooks** (`src/hooks/property.hooks.js`)
   - Uses `toast.isActive()` and `toastId` to prevent duplicates
   - All error toasts have unique IDs

2. **Schedule Hooks** (`src/hooks/schedule.hooks.js`)
   - Uses `toast.isActive()` and `toastId` to prevent duplicates
   - All error toasts have unique IDs

3. **User Hooks** (`src/hooks/user.hooks.js`)
   - Updated to use `toast.isActive()` and `toastId` to prevent duplicates
   - All error toasts now have unique IDs

## Utility Functions

Utility functions that cannot use React hooks continue to use direct toast imports:

1. **Core Utilities** (`src/utils/core.tsx`)
   - Uses direct `toast` import for error handling
   - Appropriate for utility functions that aren't React components

2. **Toast Utilities** (`src/utils/toastMsg.tsx`)
   - Maintains backward compatibility with direct imports
   - Exports responsive functions for new implementations

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (> 768px)
- Toasts appear in the top-right corner
- Standard sizing and spacing
- Multiple toasts stack vertically with proper spacing

### Mobile (≤ 768px)
- Toasts appear centered at the top of the screen
- Reduced font sizes for better readability
- Narrower width (90vw) to fit mobile screens
- Closer stacking to conserve screen space

### Small Mobile (≤ 480px)
- Even narrower width (95vw)
- Further reduced font sizes
- Minimal spacing to maximize content area

## Developer Guidelines

### For New Components
1. Import the responsive toast hook:
   ```typescript
   import { useResponsiveToast } from "@/hooks/useResponsiveToast";
   ```

2. Use the hook in your component:
   ```typescript
   const { toastSuccess, toastError } = useResponsiveToast();
   ```

3. Call the appropriate functions:
   ```typescript
   toastSuccess("Operation completed!");
   toastError("Something went wrong");
   ```

### For Hooks
1. Continue using direct `toast` imports
2. Implement duplicate prevention using `toast.isActive()` and `toastId`:
   ```javascript
   if (!toast.isActive("unique-error-id")) {
     toast.error(message, { toastId: "unique-error-id" });
   }
   ```

### For Utility Functions
1. Use direct `toast` imports when hooks cannot be used
2. No need for duplicate prevention (handled by calling components)

## Testing

To verify responsive behavior:
1. Use browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes
2. Check toast positioning on mobile (centered) vs desktop (top-right)
3. Verify font sizes adjust appropriately
4. Ensure multiple toasts stack properly on mobile
5. Test on actual mobile devices when possible

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more responsive options (e.g., bottom positioning on mobile)
2. Add animations for toast entry/exit on mobile
3. Implement swipe-to-dismiss on mobile devices
4. Add theme switching based on device preferences
